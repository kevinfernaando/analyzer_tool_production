XRAY - Avg Days to Median % Overrun:

Results (4 events)
• Events used (ex-dates): 2024-09-27, 2024-12-27, 2025-03-28, 2025-06-27
• Median % Overrun (M): 1.8845%
• (Computed as median of the four event peaks: 3.5081%, 0.2610%, 0.0000%, 5.8125% → middle two average = 1.8845%.)
• Time to Median: among events that reached M, median = 1 day (mean = 1 day).
• Reach Rate: 50% (2 of 4 events reached ≥ M within T0→T+4).

Per-event quick summary

(Full per-event detail is in the CSV/visible table.)
1. Ex-date 2024-09-27 — T-1 Close 26.51
• Daily overruns (T0→T+4): 3.508%, 2.150%, 2.452%, 0.000%, 0.000%
• Peak = 3.508% (earliest at T0)
• Reached M (1.8845%) at T0 → Tᵢ = 0

2. Ex-date 2024-12-27 — T-1 Close 19.16
• Daily overruns: 0.000%, 0.000%, 0.000%, 0.261%, 0.000%
• Peak = 0.261% (T+3)
• Did not reach M → Tᵢ = n/a

3. Ex-date 2025-03-28 — T-1 Close 15.64
• Daily overruns: 0.000%, 0.000%, 0.000%, 0.000%, 0.000%
• Peak = 0.000% (T0)
• Did not reach M → Tᵢ = n/a

4. Ex-date 2025-06-27 — T-1 Close 16.00
• Daily overruns: 0.000%, 0.000%, 5.812%, 4.562%, 1.875%
• Peak = 5.812% (T+2)
• Reached M at T+2 → Tᵢ = 2

Proof (one event, worked by hand)

Take 2024-09-27 (Ex-date).
• T-1 Close (Target) = 26.51 (on 2024-09-26).
• T0 High = 27.440001 ⇒
O_0 = (27.440001 - 26.51) / 26.51 \times 100\% = 3.5081\% (≥ 0, keep).
• By comparison to M = 1.8845%, it crosses at T0, so Tᵢ = 0.
